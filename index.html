            data-bio="Pedro Ferreira was born in Guimarães in 1973. He has an MSc in Telecommunications and Computers and his professional career has always been linked to the broadcasting industry, firstly as a researcher at INESC Porto, then as a co-founder of MOG.<br/>He enjoys not only programming and programming languages, but also enjoys learning and sharing knowledge. That’s why he’s trainer at EUROVISION and is looking forward to Commit Porto 2017."
            data-talkDesc="The web said C++ is dead, however, C++ ranks very high on the usage indices and is growing.<br/>Why? Performance still matters, so, believe it or not, battery life and data center cooling are major drivers behind this.<br/>This talk will present how C++ has evolved, how it lends itself to multicore-friendly paradigms such as functional programming, and how it is being used by companies like Facebook and others to gain efficiency both on the data center and on the mobile phone.">

            data-bio="Cristiano Cunha is the Automation Team Manager in Farfetch, he is passionate about testing, automation and delivery process improvement. He started his career as a developer and evolved to be a tester, now working for over 7 years in the area.<br />His career path having been on both sides of the trenches provided him with a unique view of process and the challenges it puts forward."
            data-talkDesc="In a company that was used to test the features in a more manual way, the continuous growth and the evolution to continuous delivery makes that the test mindset had to change. The way we were used to perform testing changed to adapt to the new needs of Continuous Delivery, where we need to be fast to validate the increasing number of builds while not losing confidence on the quality of the delivery.">

His previous experience had him working with the folks at Portugal Telecom and Blip. When not working with computers, he enjoys gaming and being an avid indoor enthusiast."
            data-talkDesc="In the days of rising clouds, self-healing infrastructures and stupidly cheap disks, developers often work around performance and capacity issues by throwing hardware at problems. This talk is about NOT doing that. Instead, it is about understanding the inner workings of languages and platforms and how we can use that knowledge for our own fun and profit. You can expect to hear about Java, Performance and Strings. Strings are exciting aren't they?">

            data-talkDesc="Marketing analytics exists to empower decision makers with real valuable solutions, to turn bytes into actions. However, many companies struggle to realize the full potential of their analytical efforts and face even more difficulties in realizing the power of a Customer Centric marketing strategy.<br />These pictures need to be placed over real customer and business knowledge added with technical and advanced analytical skills. And this relies on people.<br />Companies need to adapt themselves to the new world… analytics can help them.">

On these companies, he has delivered worldwide projects that involved thousands of daily transactions and many GBs of data.<br />In terms of technologies, although the first years were focused mainly on iOS applications, he has now moved into big data and AI when he joined Movvo and later Feedzai.<br />Mauro loves sports, is a serious console gamer (Xbox One fan) and it's keen on bonsai trees."
            data-talkDesc="When you work on SaaS projects and things go wrong you can “easy” change and adapt the code releasing it on the same day with minimum downtime. On the other side, there are times where your products require you to deliver them in closed/controlled environments. In iOS and Fintech your installations run on your client and you have little control over it. We will go through those not so easy environments and things you can do to ease this pain and reduce this barrier.">

I headed the Innovation Management team from 2011, coordinating a project held crosswise on Contextual Design, and started leading the Usability and User Experience team on 2015."
            data-talkDesc="Can you think of a system you would need to consult every day, 8 hours a day, in which you would need to quickly, efficiently and effectively identify information, act over it, keep track of it, inform others about it, all of this while talking to a client? These are the systems we work for, transform and deliver. Powering UX at such systems is an everyday challenge. The business and technological specificities make this experience unique, and a good one to share.">

As Digital Advisor my work consists of challenging my customers with new ideas and ways for them to take the most out of technology, which for me makes this one of the best jobs in the world. With my free time when I get any I love to hop on my motorcycle, or get my scuba gear and go dive, or gather a bunch of friends and play some boardgames."
            data-talkDesc="Everyone is talking about is AI nowadays. The truth is, today it’s easy to build intelligent things without having to know a lot about AI. I’ll be showing you the Microsoft Cognitive Services Portfolio Hand-on. The focus will be around Natural Language Processing.

            data-talkDesc="The world is changing! It seems a cliché but the change is real. Mobile has taken over our lives and people are used to text each others. Remember that Facebook paid $19B for WhatsApp? With users spending lot of time on messaging applications, the latest trend was born - Chatbots. Though they seem as simple as exchanging messages between 2 ends, they are becoming a powerful platform for building flows/applications very quickly using an interface where users feel at home. We will explore chatbots, their underlying mechanisms, the challenges we faced while building a chatbot platform and how we solved them (or not).">

            data-talkDesc="Registration of attendees sits at the core of running a conference. When running conferences in different cities and timezones – from Lisbon to Hong Kong to New Orleans –, the number of variables that can (and will!) go wrong increases drastically. In this talk, we'll explore the tale of how Ruby, Saltstack and CouchDB mix together with good software architecture and complex distributed systems to produce a world-class level of service.">
